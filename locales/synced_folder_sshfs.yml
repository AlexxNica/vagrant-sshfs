        communicator_not_ready: |-
          The machine is reporting that it is not ready to communicate via ssh. Verify
          this machine is properly running.
        exe_not_in_host: |-
          The '%{executable}' executable file can't be found on the host machine but
          is required for sshfs mounting to work. Please install the software and 
          try again.
        sshfs_not_in_guest: |-
          The necessary SSHFS software is not installed in the guest. 
        install_failed_arch: |-
          The install of the sshfs client software failed. On Arch this is most likely
          because the package lists are not up to date [1] and partial upgrades are not
          supported [2]. Please update your Arch system or install SSHFS manually.

        normal_mount_failed: |-
          Mounting SSHFS shared folders failed. This is most often caused by either an
          SSH Daemon not running on the target host or invalid credentials being provided.
          Please make sure an SSH daemon is running on the host and proper credentials
          were provided to be able to authenticate via SSH.

          The command and output are:

          %{command}

          Stdout from the command:

          %{stdout}

          Stderr from the command:

          %{stderr}
        slave_mount_failed: |-
          Mounting SSHFS shared via slave SSHFS mount failed. Please look at your 
          terminal scrollback to look for any error messages from the processes that 
          were run.
